Ancestral haplotype - `AGT`

*i. Calculate the derived allele frequency for each loci for both populations*

North China = 1/4, 3/4, 1/4

South China = 0/4, 1/4, 0/4

*ii. Calculate the unfolded site-frequency spectrum for each population*

North China = (2, 0, 1)

South China = (1, 0, 0)

*iii. Estimate $\theta$ for each population*

Ancestral allele labelled as `0` and derived allele labelled as `1`

For North China,

Pairwise differences = (1 ($d_{12}$) + 2 ($d_{13}$) + 2 ($d_{14}$) + 1 ($d_{23}$) + 1 ($d_{24}$) + 2 ($d_{34}$))

$\pi = \frac{9}{\frac{4 \times 3}{2}} = \frac{9}{6} = 1.5$


For South China,

Pairwise differences = (0 ($d_{12}$) + 0 ($d_{13}$) + 1 ($d_{14}$) + 0 ($d_{23}$) + 1 ($d_{24}$) + 1 ($d_{34}$))


$\pi = \frac{3}{\frac{4 \times 3}{2}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5$

*iv. Assuming constant population size and equal mutation rate, which population has the higher $N_{e}$?*

With $\theta = 4N_{e}\mu$, the population with the larger value of $\hat{\theta}_{T}$ (North China) has the larger effective population size.
